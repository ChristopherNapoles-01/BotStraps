					<h3>Tip # 1 -Please Stay at home</h3>
					<p>Staying at home is the best way to avoid CoVid-19. Staying at home can assure yout that you will not have the disease unless 1 of your housemate already have the virus,
						 but still it is the best way of protecting yourself from the virus because you will be away from a lot of people that we do not know if they are already infected or not.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-lg-4 offset-lg-1" id="section2">
					<h3>Tip # 2 - Wash your hands frequently</h3>
					<p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, 
						between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. 
						Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-lg-4" id="section3">
					<h3>Tip # 3 - Wear face masks when going out</h3>
					<p>Can face masks help slow the spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19? Yes, face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand-washing and social distancing, help slow the spread of the virus.
            		So why weren't face masks recommended at the start of the pandemic? At that time, experts didn't know the extent to which people with COVID-19 could spread the virus before symptoms appeared. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-lg-4 offset-lg-1" id="section4">
					<h3>Tip # 4 - Cover your mouth and nose while you cough or sneeze</h3>
					<p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days. 
					Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-lg-4" id="section5">
					<h3>Tip # 5 - Social or Physical Distancing</h3>
					<p>Social distancing, also called "physical distancing," means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household.
					To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms'length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box col-lg-4 offset-lg-1 " id="section6">
					<h3>Tip # 6 - Disinfect your groceries</h3>
					<p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. 
					Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
